models
=======

Demonstration and testing models in xtUML form.  


__NOTE:__ This repository has some very long paths that need to be managed carefully on Windows-based machines.  The GitHub for Windows tool is unable to handle these long paths.  We recommend using the eGit plug-ins inside eclipse (and therefore BridgePoint and xtUML Editor) or the git tools inside cygwin to clone and manage the contents of this repository.
